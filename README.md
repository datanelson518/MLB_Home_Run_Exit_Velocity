## Problem Statement

Using the physical data about baseballs combined with the personal and game statistics for each player that hit a home run, between the years of 2015 and 2017, I will use regression modeling to predict the exit velocity of each home run hit. Using the predicted values I will draw a conclusion about the changes made to baseballs to determine if their is an influence on exit velocities from "juiced" baseballs.
